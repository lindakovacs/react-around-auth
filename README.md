**Description of the project and its functionality**

The project takes [the last](https://github.com/lindakovacs/around-react) from React using the Create React App to adding authorization functionality.
This repository will contain the front-end project on React with added authorization and registration features.
Uses the previously built front end from Sprint 11, or front end together with the back end built in sprints 12 and 13. 
All authorization, registration and token requests goes through to the server running on https://register.nomoreparties.co. Other requests which are not specified in this project may be connected to either this back end server, or the one have been building.

A responsive website using HTML5, CSS3 (flexbox, grid, BEM), JavaScript, built following the design mokup in Figma. 
This adaptive page includes form validation, interactive popups, fade-in and fade-out animations, functional like and delete buttons, modular JavaScript, and Object Oriented JS design.
The React Framework is used to add functionality to Form Fields in a Popup Box and save the edited values. Used BEM methodology with a nested file structure. 
The project interactivity includes:

- Popup modals for: Updating profile info and avatar image, Adding new cards and Deleting user's owncards only

* Export images directly from Figma and optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

**Images**

All the images and profile info are pulled from the shared server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
